            <h1>INSPIRATION</h1>
            <p>It's important for artists to get inspiration from their personal life AND other artists! Think about what motivates you and what common ideas / imagery you get drawn back to. <br> <br>
            My important themes? Time, Confidence, Movement in Nature. <br> <br>
            This part of my website is to help show where I get inspiration, so please have fun checking out some the artists that inspire me. My personal photos I will leave out - but know that they are important to have!</p>
